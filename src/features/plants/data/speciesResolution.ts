/**
 * Resolving a species: everything between "we have a Perenual id or a name" and "we have a
 * PlantSpecies the UI can render".
 *
 * This lived in PlantDataProvider, which meant that file changed for four unrelated reasons --
 * owned-plant CRUD, the detection log, Library hand-off state, and this pipeline. A Perenual or
 * Unsplash change and a watering change landed in the same 721-line file. It also made these
 * pure async functions testable only through a rendered provider: PlantDataProvider.test.tsx
 * mounted a React tree and mocked four service modules to exercise orchestration with no UI in it.
 *
 * Nothing here touches React. The provider binds it to state; this decides what a species is.
